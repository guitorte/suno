Suno Prompt Guide
Important note
Many of these suno voice tags are hit and miss. Instead, I’ve found a really good strategy is to use a vocal sample from Splice.

From here you can:

Upload the vocal sample
Extend the song but add in different lyrics
Or try using the cover option.
Use the suno voice tags to manipulate the vocal to get the sound you want
Layer in more styles by repeating the process with different style prompts
Get the vocal and instrumental stems and delete any vocals you don’t want
Find a vocal sample on Splice

Here is an example house song that used a Splice sample:
