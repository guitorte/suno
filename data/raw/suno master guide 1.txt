Day #9 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎵 TRICK #15: Vocal Register Control per Section
### Biasing Range and Physical Effort

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

**Vocal register** = which part of the voice is used, and how much effort.

Register labels bias:
- Pitch range
- Breathiness
- Vocal effort

They do NOT enforce correct technique.  
They **suggest performance energy**.

---

### Available Registers

| Register | Character | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| `Falsetto` | Light, airy, high, head voice | Ethereal moments, vulnerability |
| `Chest Voice` | Full, powerful, grounded | Confident delivery |
| `Head Voice` | Clear, light, high but full | Pop brightness |
| `Mixed Voice` | Balanced, versatile | Modern pop/R&B |
| `Whispered` | Soft, intimate | Secret, vulnerable |
| `Spoken Word` | Narrative, non-melodic | Rap verses, intros |
| `Raspy` | Hoarse, gritty | Rock, blues, raw emotion |
| `Belted` | Maximum power, full volume | Climax moments |

---

### Emotional Mapping

| Register | Emotion |
|----------|---------|
| Falsetto | Vulnerability, dream, longing |
| Chest | Strength, determination, confidence |
| Whispered | Intimacy, secrets, fragility |
| Belted | Climax, liberation, triumph |
| Raspy | Pain, experience, authenticity |

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Intro: Falsetto, Ethereal]
Ooh... floating above the clouds...
drifting away...

[Verse 1: Chest Voice, Conversational]
But then I woke up to reality
The dream was gone, just a memory
Walking through these empty streets
Searching for what I need

[Pre-Chorus: Mixed Voice, Building]
And I can feel it rising up inside

[Chorus: Belted, Powerful]
I WON'T GIVE UP, I'LL CARRY ON!
EVEN WHEN THE HOPE IS GONE!
I'LL FIGHT UNTIL THE BREAK OF DAWN!

[Bridge: Whispered, Intimate]
(Maybe if I close my eyes...)
(I can find my way back home...)

[Final Chorus: Belted, Maximum Intensity]
I WON'T GIVE UP!
```

**Style:**
```
Alternative rock, dynamic male vocals, emotional journey, building intensity, mid-tempo (95-105 BPM), anthemic chorus, raw and vulnerable verses, explosive climax, guitar-driven, modern rock production
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Tempo is very fast (no time for register shifts)
- ❌ Lyrics are too dense
- ❌ Too many register changes (more than 4-5)
- ❌ Registers contradict the genre

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use at structural moments** — verse vs chorus, not every line
- **Create arc** — start soft, build to powerful
- **Match emotion to register** — vulnerable = whispered/falsetto
- **Don't over-specify** — 3-4 register changes per song

Day #13 of sharing my dirty tricks

## TRICK #20: Remix with 55% Audio Influence for "Live Feel"
### Re-Contextualizing Existing Audio

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

This is one of the **few production tricks that consistently works**.

### What This Trick Actually Does

Remixing an existing track with moderate audio influence:
- Preserves melody and structure
- Introduces looseness and imperfection
- Adds performance artifacts
- Creates "live" feel from "studio" track

---

### Why 55%?

| Influence | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| ≤50% | Too different, loses melody |
| **55%** | **Sweet spot** - preserves structure, adds character |
| ≥60% | Not enough transformation |

---

### Workflow

1. Generate your perfect studio quality track
2. Go to **Remix**
3. Set **Audio Influence: 55%**
4. Add live-focused style
5. Generate

---

### Venue Presets

**Stadium:**
```
Live recording, massive stadium, 50,000 people, arena rock sound, crowd energy, echo and space, raw performance, epic atmosphere
```

**Jazz Club:**
```
Live recording, small jazz club, intimate setting, audience chatter between songs, vintage feel, smoky atmosphere, close mic, room ambience
```

**Underground:**
```
Live recording, warehouse rave, raw energy, lo-fi recording quality, underground electronic, crowd movement, bass-heavy room sound
```

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**After generating a studio track, Remix with:**

**Style:**
```
Live recording at Madison Square Garden, massive stadium atmosphere, 50,000 people, arena rock sound, raw performance energy, crowd singing along, imperfect timing, authentic concert recording, epic live feel, audience interaction
```

**Audio Influence:** 55%

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- Original audio is too clean/sterile
- Influence pushed too high (over 60%)
- Genre discourages looseness (EDM, electronic)
- Venue choice contradicts style

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Start at 55%**, adjust ±5% if needed
- **Choose venue that matches genre**
- **Don't expect sound effects** - think atmosphere, not literal sounds
- **Generate 2-3 variations**

Day #12 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎛️ TRICK #19: Pro Studio Equipment Keywords
### Semantic Association, Not Simulation

**Reliability: ★★☆☆☆ Low**

> 🔮 **HIGHLY SPECULATIVE**: The AI does NOT simulate actual equipment. These keywords work (if at all) through semantic association—the AI has learned that content mentioning "Neumann" or "Neve" is often associated with professional productions.

### What This Trick Actually Does

Mentioning:
- Neumann microphones
- Neve consoles
- SSL boards
- Tape machines
- Tube preamps

does NOT simulate hardware.

It MIGHT trigger **aesthetic associations**:
- Vintage warmth
- Professional clarity
- Analog character
- Expensive sound

---

### Equipment Keywords Reference

**Microphones:**
```
"Neumann U 87 microphone, pristine vocal capture"
"SM58, live raw sound"
"Ribbon microphone, warm vintage tone"
```

**Preamps and Consoles:**
```
"Neve console warmth, API punch"
"Mixed on SSL, clean and powerful"
"Tube preamp saturation"
```

**Recording Medium:**
```
"Recorded to tape, analog warmth"
"2-inch tape machine, vintage saturation"
```

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Style:**
```
Singer-songwriter, acoustic studio recording, Neumann microphone clarity, Neve preamp warmth, intimate female vocals, fingerpicked guitar, slow tempo (75-85 BPM), warm analog feel, professional yet intimate, vintage-inspired, recorded to tape aesthetic
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails **often**.

- ❌ Stacked excessively (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Used as substitute for good structure
- ❌ Expected to "fix" bad prompts
- ❌ Contradicts genre (lo-fi with "pristine Neumann"?)

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use sparingly, or not at all**
- **Don't expect miracles**
- **Better to focus on style and structure**
- **This is the weakest production trick**

---

Day #11 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎚️ TRICK #17: "Clean" and "FLAC" Keywords for Quality
### Slightly Improving Model Decisions

**Reliability: ★★☆☆☆ Low-Medium**

> 🔮 **HIGHLY SPECULATIVE**: This technique is based on community theories, NOT confirmed Suno behavior. There is NO evidence that Suno processes audio at different quality levels based on text. Consider this a placebo technique that MAY have subtle effects through semantic association.

### What This Trick Actually Does

Keywords like:
- Clean
- FLAC
- High fidelity
- Studio polish
- Professional mix

do NOT increase bitrate or resolution.

They MAY bias Suno toward:
- Simpler arrangements
- Less distortion
- More conservative mixing choices
- Cleaner frequency separation

**Think of it as reducing chaos, not increasing quality.**

---

### Quality Keywords Reference

| Keyword | Theoretical Effect |
|---------|-------------------|
| `Clean` | Balanced mix, no mud |
| `FLAC` | High fidelity, sonic detail |
| `Studio Polish` | Professional production |
| `High Fidelity` | Maximum quality |
| `Pristine` | Clear, detailed |
| `Professional Mix` | Well-balanced |
| `Crystal Clear` | Bright, clean |
| `Mastered` | Polished final sound |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse]
Feel the rhythm taking over
Let the bass control your soul
We're dancing into the sunrise

[Drop | Explosive | Clean Mix]
Drop it low!
Feel the flow!
Let it go!
```

**Style:**
```
EDM progressive house, clean production, FLAC quality sound, studio polish, professional mix, high fidelity, crisp highs, tight controlled bass, balanced frequencies, mid-tempo (120-128 BPM), festival anthem, pristine sound design
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Genre expects dirt (lo-fi, grunge, punk)
- ❌ Distortion is core to the style
- ❌ Audio input contradicts cleanliness
- ❌ You expect dramatic quality improvement

---

### Reality Check

> ⚠️ **Suno outputs at a fixed quality level.** These keywords may influence production style choices (cleaner arrangements, less distortion) but do NOT change actual audio encoding quality.

**Realistic expectation:** 5-10% improvement in perceived clarity, at best.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use as seasoning**, not main ingredient
- **Don't stack excessively** — 2-3 quality keywords max
- **Match to genre** — clean works for EDM, not for lo-fi
- **Combine with good structure** — keywords can't fix bad songs

---

Day #10 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 💔 TRICK #16: Emotion Switching per Section
### Programming Emotional Arcs

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

Instead of one global mood, you assign **different emotions to different sections**.

This biases:
- Melody shape
- Intensity
- Harmonic tension (dark vs bright)
- Pacing

---

### How AI Responds to Emotion Tags

| Emotional Tag | AI Adjustment |
|---------------|---------------|
| Sad | Minor key, slower, sparse |
| Angry | Aggressive voice, faster, louder |
| Desperate | Sparse instruments, raw vocals |
| Explosive | Full band, maximum energy |
| Melancholic | Slower tempo, minor harmonies |
| Euphoric | Faster, major key, bright |
| Defiant | Strong delivery, powerful |
| Reflective | Gentle, thoughtful pacing |
| Triumphant | Full arrangement, victorious |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse 1: Sad, Melancholic, Slow, Resigned]
I lost you in the autumn rain
The leaves fell down like tears
Everything we built together
Disappeared with all those years

[Verse 2: Angry, Bitter, Rising Tension]
But now I see you never cared
You played me like a fool
I gave you everything I had
And you broke every rule

[Chorus: Triumphant, Defiant, Explosive]
But I'M FREE NOW! I'M FINALLY FREE!
NO MORE CHAINS HOLDING ME!
I'M STRONGER THAN I'VE EVER BEEN!
THIS IS MY VICTORY!

[Bridge: Reflective, Bittersweet, Gentle]
Maybe someday I'll forgive...
Maybe time will heal these wounds...
But right now I'm just grateful
That I finally found the truth
```

**Style:**
```
Emotional rock ballad, powerful female vocals, dynamic journey from soft to explosive, piano to full band arrangement, slow-mid tempo (80-90 BPM), cinematic build, cathartic release, strong emotional arc, modern rock production
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Emotions contradict tempo (sad + fast)
- ❌ Everything is labeled emotional (no contrast)
- ❌ Emotions change too frequently
- ❌ Labels are too subtle or similar

**Key insight:** Emotion only works when it **changes**. Contrast is everything.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Create clear emotional arc** — beginning → middle → end
- **Use contrasting emotions** — sad verse, triumphant chorus
- **Limit emotion labels** — 3-4 per song
- **Match to lyrics** — emotion should reinforce the words

Day #7 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 💎 TRICK #12: Vocal Adlibs with Brackets
### Injecting Non-Lyrical Vocal Events

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

Square brackets `[...]` often produce:
- Adlibs
- Interjections
- Non-melodic vocal sounds

---

### Syntax Example

```
I'm on top [yeah!] of the world [uh!]
Living my life [let's go!] no regrets [ayy!]
Can't stop me now [woah!] I'm unstoppable [skrrt!]
```

**Each `[...]` = separate adlib vocal layer.**

---

### Adlibs by Genre Reference

| Genre | Common Adlibs |
|-------|---------------|
| Hip Hop/Trap | [yeah!], [uh!], [ayy!], [skrrt!], [woah!], [let's go!] |
| R&B/Soul | [ooh], [ahhh], [mmm], [oh yeah], [baby] |
| Rock/Metal | [hey!], [go!], [yeah!], [whoa-oh], [come on!] |
| Pop | [oh oh oh], [na na na], [la la la], [hey hey] |
| Latin | [dale!], [oye!], [vamos!] |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse]
Making moves [uh!] every day [yeah!]
Getting paid [money!] in every way [let's go!]
Haters mad [hah!] but I don't care [nah!]
I'm the king [boss!] everywhere [ayy!]

[Chorus]
We on top [woah!]
Never gonna stop [skrrt!]
Living life [yeah yeah!]
Doing it right [let's get it!]
```

**Style:**
```
Trap, confident male rapper, aggressive delivery, heavy 808 bass, crispy hi-hats, ad-libs throughout, hard-hitting drums, fast tempo (135-145 BPM), dark and energetic, Atlanta trap influence, modern production
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Used too frequently (every word)
- ❌ Lyrics are already overcrowded
- ❌ Genre doesn't use adlibs (classical, ambient)
- ❌ Adlibs don't match genre conventions

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Adlibs = punctuation**, not sentences
- **Match genre** — use appropriate adlibs for the style
- **Don't overload** — 2-3 per verse is plenty
- **Place strategically** — end of lines, between phrases

---

## PART II — FINAL NOTES

Lyrics are not just content.

They are:
- Instructions
- Triggers
- Control signals

**Key insight:** Once you treat text as an **interface**, not just poetry, results improve dramatically.

The AI doesn't care about meaning.  
It cares about **patterns**.

---
<!--PAGEBREAK-->
# PART III: VOCAL CONTROL TECHNIQUES
## Steering Who Sings, How They Sing, and Why It Changes Everything

Vocal control in Suno is **never explicit**.

You cannot select:
- A specific singer
- A precise timbre
- An exact technique

What you CAN do is **bias the model toward certain vocal behaviors**.

---

## Important Reality Check

Suno does not generate "a singer."

It generates:
- Vocal **patterns**
- Delivery **styles**
- Performance **contexts**

Every trick here works by **narrowing the probability space**, not issuing commands.

---

Day #8 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎭 TRICK #14: Forced Multi-Voice Duets
### Creating the Illusion of Multiple Singers

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High (but fragile)**

### What This Trick Actually Does

This trick biases Suno into generating:
- Two distinct vocal roles
- Alternating delivery
- Perceived gender contrast

It does NOT guarantee:
- Stable vocal identity throughout
- Consistent timbre per character
- Realistic harmony balance

---

### Critical Requirement

> ⚠️ **You MUST specify "Duet" in the Style prompt!**

Without the word "duet," Suno collapses everything into a single voice.

---

### Available Vocal Tags

| Tag | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `[Male Vocal]` | Male voice |
| `[Female Vocal]` | Female voice |
| `[Both Vocals]` | Both together |
| `[Male Lead, Female Backing]` | Male front, female background |
| `[Female Lead, Male Harmony]` | Female front, male harmony |
| `[Duet]` | Both voices, balanced |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse 1: Male Vocal]
I walked away from everything we had
Left you standing in the rain
I thought that I could make it on my own
But nothing's ever been the same

[Verse 2: Female Vocal]
You let me go without a fight
Didn't even say goodbye
Now I'm standing here alone tonight
Wondering why, wondering why

[Chorus: Both Vocals, Harmony]
But we still love each other
Can't deny what we feel inside
Maybe we should try again
And let our broken hearts heal

[Bridge: Female Lead, Male Backing]
If you come back to me (come back to me)
I promise I won't leave (won't leave)
We can start again (start again)
```

**Style:**
```
Emotional Pop Ballad Duet, Male and Female Vocals, romantic and heartfelt, piano-driven arrangement, slow tempo (70-80 BPM), cinematic build, orchestral swells, intimate verses, powerful harmonized chorus, modern adult contemporary
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ "Duet" is missing from Style (critical!)
- ❌ Both roles have identical lyrics
- ❌ Section labels are unclear
- ❌ Too many voice switches (confuses AI)

**What happens when it fails:** One voice dominates, or voices blend into an indistinct mess.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Always include "Duet" in style** — this is non-negotiable
- **Clear section labels** — be explicit about who sings
- **Contrast the lyrics** — different perspectives help differentiation
- **Limit voice switches** — 4-6 per song maximum

---

Day #5 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎙️ TRICK #10: Parentheses for Background Vocals
### Creating Automatic Harmonies and Adlibs

**Reliability: ★★★★★ Very High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

Text in `(parentheses)` is treated as:
- Secondary
- Background
- Supportive

Suno often renders it as:
- Backing vocals
- Harmonies
- Call-and-response
- Adlibs

---

### Why This Works

Parentheses in written text mean "additional, secondary information."

Suno translates this to:
> "Sing this in the background, not as the main vocal."

---

### Examples by Genre

**Call-and-Response (Hip Hop/R&B):**
```
I'm walking alone (walking alone)
Through the city lights (ooh ooh ooh)
Nobody knows my name (knows my name)
```

**Gospel/Soul Harmonies:**
```
He lifted me up (lifted me up!)
Out of the darkness (hallelujah!)
Into the light (praise the Lord!)
```

**Trap Adlibs:**
```
I got that money (yeah!)
Stacking it high (skrrt skrrt!)
Living my life (ayy! ayy!)
```

---

### Advanced: Multiple Layers

```
I'm breaking free (breaking free) (ooh) (yeah yeah)
```

**Each parenthesis = separate vocal layer.**

More parentheses = more backing vocal density.

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse]
I've been waiting (waiting)
For so long (so long)
For someone like you (ooh ooh)
To come along (come along)

[Chorus]
You're the one (the one!)
That I need (that I need!)
Forever and always (always!) (yeah yeah!)
You're everything to me (ooh)
```

**Style:**
```
Neo-soul, smooth R&B groove, female vocals with layered harmonies, call and response structure, warm production, mid-tempo (85-95 BPM), intimate and romantic, live band feel, rich vocal arrangement, gospel influence
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick rarely fails.

It may collapse into unison when:
- ❌ Tempo is extremely fast
- ❌ Lyrics are too dense
- ❌ Too many parentheses per line

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use consistently** — establish the pattern early
- **Vary the content** — mix echoes, adlibs, and harmonies
- **Don't overload** — 1-2 parentheses per line maximum
- **Match genre conventions** — hip hop = adlibs, soul = harmonies

Day #6 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🧬 TRICK #11: Tag Stacking with PIPE Symbol
### Preventing Instructional Collapse

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

The pipe symbol `|` separates instructions cleanly.

Without it, long tags blur together and confuse the AI.

---

### The Problem

```
❌ WRONG (9 adjectives, confused AI):
[Chorus: Anthemic, Powerful, Epic, Orchestral, Dramatic, 
Climactic, Intense, Explosive, Grandiose]
```

Too many adjectives = AI doesn't know which to prioritize.

---

### The Solution: PIPE Operator

```
✅ CORRECT (7 elements, clearly separated):
[Chorus | Anthemic | Stacked Harmonies | Brass Section | 
Bass Drop | Wide Stereo | Heavy Compression]
```

Each element is processed as a separate instruction.

---

### Optimal Element Order

```
[Section | Mood/Energy | Vocal Style | Key Instruments | 
Dynamic/Movement | Spatial/Effects | Production Style]
```

Priority flows left to right. Most important = first.

---

### Genre Examples

**EDM Drop:**
```
[Drop | Explosive | Vocoder Vocals | Synth Lead | 
Bass Drop | Sidechain Compression | Wall of Sound]
```

**Jazz Ballad:**
```
[Verse | Intimate | Smooth Female Vocals | Piano Solo | 
Gentle Dynamics | Close Mic | Warm Analog]
```

**Rock Anthem:**
```
[Chorus | Anthemic | Full Band | Distorted Guitars | 
Building Energy | Wide Stereo | Arena Sound]
```

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Intro | Atmospheric | Soft Synth Pad | Building]

[Verse | Intimate | Whispered Male Vocals | Minimal Beat | 
Lo-Fi Texture | Close and Personal]
I've been lost in the city lights
Searching for meaning every night

[Chorus | Explosive | Full Voice | Layered Synths | 
Driving Beat | Wide Stereo | Euphoric]
BUT NOW I'VE FOUND MY WAY!
NOTHING CAN STOP ME TODAY!

[Outro | Fading | Reverb Decay | Peaceful Resolution]
```

**Style:**
```
Indie electronic pop, emotional male vocals, dynamic contrast between sections, mid-tempo (105-115 BPM), synth-driven, intimate verses, anthemic chorus, modern production, cinematic feel
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ More than 7 elements per tag
- ❌ Contradictory elements (intimate + explosive together)
- ❌ Used without clear section structure

---

### Iteration Advice

- **MAX 7 elements per tag** — beyond = confusion
- **Prioritize** — put most important elements first
- **Be specific** — "Guitar Solo" not just "Guitar"
- **Match to style prompt** — tags should reinforce, not contradict

Day #4 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎶 TRICK #9: Vocal Stretching and Stuttering
### Manipulating Timing Inside Words

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

Hyphens and letter repetition stretch syllables.

They bias Suno toward:
- Longer notes
- Melismatic delivery (multiple notes per syllable)
- Stuttered phrasing

---

### Technique #1: Stretching (Long Notes)

```
I lo-o-o-o-o-ve you
Forever-e-e-e-r-r-r
Sta-a-a-a-ay with me-e-e-e
```

**Each hyphen = extended note duration.**

Best for: Ballads, soul, gospel, emotional moments.

---

### Technique #2: Stutter Effect

```
I-I-I-I want want want you you you
B-b-b-baby baby b-b-baby
```

**Repetitions = autotune-style stuttering.**

Best for: Trap, hip hop, electronic pop, EDM.

---

### Technique #3: Melodic Spelling

```
L-O-V-E spells love
G-O-O-D-B-Y-E means the end
```

**Each letter becomes a separate note.**

Best for: Pop hooks, jingles, cheerful songs.

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse]
B-b-baby, I-I-I need you
Can't sta-a-a-ay away from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you le-e-e-eave
My heart starts to ble-e-e-eed

[Chorus]
Lo-o-o-o-ove is all we need
Fore-e-e-ever you and me-e-e-e
Don't let go-o-o-o
```

**Style:**
```
Modern R&B, trap soul influence, emotional male vocals with autotune, moody late-night atmosphere, slow tempo (75-85 BPM), heavy 808 bass, sparse production, intimate delivery, stuttered vocal style
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Overused throughout entire song
- ❌ Applied to very fast tempos
- ❌ Stacked with dense, wordy lyrics
- ❌ Genre doesn't support extended vocals

**What happens when it fails:** Vocals become garbled, timing falls apart, or effect is ignored.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use sparingly** — key words and phrases only
- **Match tempo** — stretching works better at slow tempos
- **Consider genre** — trap loves stuttering, folk doesn't
- **Test with 2-3 variations** before committing

## 📣 TRICK #6: ALL CAPS for Emotional Spikes
### Forcing Vocal Intensity Through Typography

**Reliability: ★★★★★ Very High**

This is one of the few tricks that works **consistently**.

### What This Trick Actually Does

Capital letters signal:
- Emphasis
- Urgency
- Intensity

Suno interprets ALL CAPS as:
> "Increase vocal energy."

This affects:
- **Loudness** — gets louder
- **Aggressiveness** — more forceful delivery
- **Phrasing** — more dramatic
- **Articulation** — clearer, stronger

---

### Why This Works

Training data strongly associates:
- ALL CAPS
- Exclamation points
- Repeated punctuation

...with emotional outbursts.

This pattern is extremely stable across models.

---

### Syntax Reference

| Format | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `ALL CAPS + !` | Powerful, shouted |
| `ALL CAPS + ?` | Dramatic, desperate |
| `ALL CAPS + ?!` | Intense questioning |
| `Mixed case + !` | Normal emphasis |
| `lowercase` | Delicate (if tagged) |

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Verse: whispered, intimate]
I tried to keep my voice down
I tried to stay calm
the memories fade away...
you're slipping from my arms...

[Pre-Chorus: building tension]
But every time I close my eyes

[Chorus: explosive, powerful]
I still LOVE YOU!
Can't you SEE?!
WHY did you go?!
I NEED YOU here with me!

[Bridge: vulnerable]
maybe it's too late...
maybe we're done...

[Final Chorus: maximum intensity]
But I won't GIVE UP!
I'LL FIGHT for us!
This isn't over YET!
```

**Style:**
```
Power ballad, emotional female vocals, 
orchestral rock arrangement, dramatic dynamics, 
slow tempo (70-80 BPM), cinematic build, 
whispered verses, explosive chorus, 
soaring melodies, emotional journey, 
piano-driven with full band climax
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick rarely fails.

It only breaks when:
- ❌ Everything is in caps (no contrast)
- ❌ Genre discourages strong vocals (ambient, minimal)

**Key insight:** Contrast is everything. Caps work because they're different from the surrounding text.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Use caps for CLIMAX MOMENTS only**
- **Create contrast** — quiet verse, loud chorus
- **Add punctuation** — ! and ?! reinforce intensity
- **Don't overuse** — if everything is shouting, nothing is

Day #2 of sharing my dirty tricks on Suno

## 🗣️ TRICK #5: Phonetic Respelling for Pronunciation Control
### Making Suno Say Words the Way You Want

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

When Suno consistently mispronounces a word in your lyrics, you can override its interpretation by **respelling the word phonetically**—writing it the way it sounds rather than how it's spelled.

This works because Suno processes text based on **pattern matching**, not linguistic understanding.

---

### Why This Works

Suno's text-to-speech component reads words based on:
- Common pronunciation patterns
- Statistical frequency of sounds
- Contextual guessing

When a word has multiple pronunciations (homographs like "read," "live," "bass"), Suno picks the statistically more common one—which may not be what you want.

**Phonetic respelling forces a specific pronunciation** by removing ambiguity.

---

### When to Use This Technique

Use phonetic respelling when:
- ✅ A word is consistently mispronounced across multiple generations
- ✅ Homographs (same spelling, different sound) are read wrong
- ✅ Technical terms or names are mangled
- ✅ You need precise pronunciation for a pun or rhyme

**Don't bother if:** The word is pronounced correctly most of the time.

---

### Technique #1: Simple Phonetic Respelling

Replace the problem word with how it sounds in everyday English.

#### Common Examples

| Standard Spelling | Phonetic Respelling | Why |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **read** (present tense) | `reed` | Forces "ree-d" instead of "red" |
| **live** (as in concert) | `lyve` | Forces "laiv" instead of "liv" |
| **bass** (instrument/low frequency) | `bahss` or `basss` | Avoids "base" pronunciation |
| **tear** (crying) | `teer` | Forces "teer" instead of "tare" |
| **wound** (injury) | `woond` | Forces "woond" instead of "wownd" |
| **lead** (metal) | `led` | Forces "led" instead of "leed" |

---

### Technique #2: Syllable Splitting with Hyphens

When simple respelling doesn't work, **split syllables with hyphens** to force Suno to treat each part separately.

**Examples:**
```
extraordinary → ex-traor-din-ary
catastrophe → ca-tas-tro-phe
pneumonia → new-moan-ya
```

This prevents Suno from "guessing" at the whole word and forces syllable-by-syllable reading.

---

### Technique #3: IPA for Stubborn Words

**IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)** is a standard system of symbols that represents exact pronunciations, independent of language or spelling.

Use IPA when:
- ❌ Phonetic respelling still fails
- ❌ The word is highly unusual or technical
- ❌ You need surgical precision for a single problem word

**IPA works best for ONE word at a time.** Using it for entire lyrics confuses Suno.

---

### IPA Example: "breath" vs "breathe"

**Problem:** Suno often reads "breath" as "breathe" (breeth instead of breth).

**Solution:** Use IPA for the specific word:
```
I'm out of /brɛθ/ again
```

The IPA `/brɛθ/` forces the short "eh" vowel and unvoiced "th" sound.

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics (Before Phonetic Fixes):**
```
[Verse]
I read your letter every night
We're going live tonight at eight
Turn up the bass, feel it in your chest
I'm out of breath, can't catch my breath
```

**Lyrics (After Phonetic Fixes):**
```
[Verse]
I reed your letter every night
We're going lyve tonight at eight
Turn up the bahss, feel it in your chest
I'm out of /brɛθ/, can't catch my /brɛθ/
```

**Style:**
```
Indie pop, conversational vocals, clear diction,
acoustic guitar, light percussion, intimate delivery,
mid-tempo (95-105 BPM), bedroom pop aesthetic,
relaxed but precise enunciation
```

---

### When This Fails

This technique fails when:
- ❌ The phonetic spelling creates a NEW mispronunciation
- ❌ You use IPA for too many words (confuses the model)
- ❌ The respelling is too different from the original word
- ❌ Suno interprets your phonetic spelling as a completely different word

**What happens when it fails:** Suno may sing gibberish, pause awkwardly, or revert to standard pronunciation anyway.

---

### Iteration Advice

1. **Start simple** — try basic phonetic respelling first (`reed`, `lyve`, `bahss`)
2. **Add hyphens if needed** — split stubborn words into syllables
3. **Reserve IPA for last resort** — use only for one or two problem words maximum
4. **Test incrementally** — fix one word at a time and regenerate
5. **Don't overdo it** — if the lyric becomes unreadable to humans, it won't work for Suno either

**Pro tip:** If phonetic respelling breaks the visual flow of your lyrics, use it only in the Suno input—keep a "clean" version saved separately for human readers.

Day #1 of sharing my dirty tricks

## 🎭 TRICK #4: Live Concert Mode with Sound Effects
### Injecting Environment and Crowd Behavior

**Reliability: ★★★★☆ High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

This trick uses **environmental cues inside the lyrics** to bias Suno toward:
- Live recordings
- Audience noise
- Imperfect timing
- Raw vocal delivery

You are NOT "adding sound effects."  
You are **changing the performance context**.

---

### Why This Works

Suno associates certain textual patterns with:
- Concert recordings
- Live performances
- Crowd interaction

When it sees those cues, it shifts:
- **Vocal polish** — decreases (more raw)
- **Timing** — becomes looser
- **Ambience** — adds space and noise

---

### Syntax Reference

**Section tags** set the context:
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]
[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Asterisks** add non-sung sound events:
```
*crowd roaring*
*audience cheering*
*applause*
```

The asterisks tell Suno: "This is not to be sung."

---

### Sound Effects Reference (Asterisk Syntax)

#### Live Atmospheres
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*crowd cheering*` | Applause and screams |
| `*audience singalong*` | Crowd singing along |
| `*festival roar*` | Stadium/festival roar |
| `*applause*` | Final applause |

#### Dramatic Effects
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*thunder*` | Thunder for epic moments |
| `*gunshots*` | For rap/trap/metal |
| `*explosion*` | For EDM drops |
| `*glass breaking*` | Breaking glass |

#### Environments
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*café ambience*` | Coffee shop chatter |
| `*rain falling*` | Melancholic atmosphere |
| `*wind howling*` | Isolated, cold feeling |

#### Narrative
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*phone ringing*` | Phone ring |
| `*door slamming*` | Door slam |
| `*footsteps*` | Footsteps |
| `*heartbeat*` | Heartbeat pulse |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]

*crowd noise building*

Are you ready tonight?!

*crowd roaring*

We came here to rock!
We came here to feel alive!

*audience cheering*

[Chorus]
This is where I belong!
Singing with you all night long!

*crowd singalong*

[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Style:**
```
Live concert recording, raw rock energy, 
festival atmosphere, audience interaction, 
stadium rock sound, powerful male vocals, 
imperfect timing, authentic live feel, 
mid-tempo (115-125 BPM), anthemic chorus, 
crowd participation, sweaty and real
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- ❌ Used with highly polished genres (clean pop, EDM)
- ❌ Combined with "clean / studio / pristine" keywords
- ❌ Overused (too many sound effect cues)
- ❌ Cues contradict the style prompt

**What happens when it fails:** Results sound confused—half studio, half live—or Suno ignores the cues entirely.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Less is more** — one or two live cues are enough
- **Match genre** — live cues work best with rock, folk, singer-songwriter
- **Place cues at structural moments** — intro, between sections, outro
- **Don't expect precise sound effects** — think "atmosphere," not "specific sound"
